## vp

The vp package converts p-values to video poker hands and overrides the default R output for regression models.

I am giving up on lecturing my clients on p values :(

### Example

```{r}
vp::toggle_stars_poker()
summary(lm(extra~group, sleep))
```

### Notes

Tens are coded as `0`, so a hand of `0000` is four tens, which beats `AAA` but loses to `QQQQ`.
